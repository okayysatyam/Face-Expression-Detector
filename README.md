# Face Expression Detector using Deep Learning

A real-time facial expression recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies emotions from facial images into categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, and more.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project applies computer vision and deep learning to detect and classify human emotions through facial expressions. It uses OpenCV for face detection and a CNN model trained on labeled data for emotion classification. The model works with static images as well as live webcam input.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed  
- Emotion classification using CNN (trained from scratch)  
- Face detection using Haar Cascades  
- Data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization  
- Simple and clean code structure for beginners and learners  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The CNN model includes:
- Multiple Convolutional layers + ReLU
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense layers with Softmax activation for multi-class classification
