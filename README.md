# Face Expression Detector using Deep Learning

A real-time facial expression recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies emotions from facial images into categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, and more.

## üîç Project Overview

This project applies computer vision and deep learning to detect and classify human emotions through facial expressions. It uses OpenCV for face detection and a CNN model trained on labeled data for emotion classification. The model works with static images as well as live webcam input.
